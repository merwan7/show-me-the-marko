# Show me the Marko!

[Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/show-me-the-marko/ecmeidkdmkkhpadjmnejiipgnpdnmbjk?hl=en-US&gl=US)

## Chrome extension details

It is a page action so the icon (![Icon displayed in URL bar](./images/marko-19.png "Icon displayed in URL bar")) only shows up in the URL bar when the page contains Marko Widgets. It is off by default -- you have to click the icon to highlight the Marko Widgets components (and you can click the icon again to toggle the highlight off). You can install this from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/show-me-the-marko/ecmeidkdmkkhpadjmnejiipgnpdnmbjk?hl=en-US&gl=US).

This was forked and adpated from [show-me-the-react](https://github.com/cymen/show-me-the-react).
